# elementary tweaks
elementary tweaks is a system settings panel for elementary OS **Juno** that lets you easily and safely customise your desktop's appearance 


![sample](docs/screenshot.png)

 
## What's New?
- Fully updated and working to reflect the changes of elementary OS Juno
- elementary-tweaks now looks more "elementary"! We've rebuilt elementary tweaks from the ground up to make it look like a native plug for your system's settings.
- Fixed: Removed theme-patcher and other more dangerous settings that were [causing problems](https://github.com/I-hate-farms/elementary-tweaks/issues/14)

[Previous Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
