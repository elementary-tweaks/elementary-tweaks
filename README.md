## What's New?

- elementary-tweaks now looks more "elementary"!. We've rebuilt elementary tweaks from the ground up to make it look like a native plug for your settings settings.
- Fixed: Removed theme-patcher and other more dangerus settings that were [causing problems](https://github.com/I-hate-farms/elementary-tweaks/issues/14)

[Previous Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)
